This is a project based on a highschool hardware project where I made a 4-bit computer out of TTL ICs. It is a design by David Feinberg and really useful for learning computer architecture
and machine code. My high school taught us the how this computer worked and let us build our own circuits. Here is a youtube video to the circuit board, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhskyN_O-eU.
I decided to create the circuit again this time using a MAX10 FPGA. The idea is to first design it using high-level SystemVerilog before going back and finding optimizations.
